## Chapter-1	INTRODUCTION

### 1.2 Problems in current mobile advertising scheme

According to a survey by Business Insider, Unsurprisingly, mobile phone users don't want advertisements when they're browsing or using their smartphones.
A new study from the Internet Advertising Bureau U.K. detailed users' feelings about mobile advertisements, and of particular note was the data that an overwhelmingly vast majority of users want the option to more easily skip or avoid ads or block ads. The survey asked respondents to respond on how they would like mobile advertisements to be adapted to improve them or make them more acceptable to users.
Respondents were mostly annoyed and irritated when they were redirected to an advertiser's website when they tried to close or block an advertisement or when they had absolute no option to close or block an advertisement at all. Specifically, respondents were irritated with three types of advertisements.

![alt text](https://github.com/KuldeepSoni17/Xplore_Final/blob/master/2.png)

First was in-page advertisements, or those that appears within content on an advertiser's webpage, such as in middle of the paragraphs of a written post. Only 18% of users felt this type of advertisement was comparatively easy to skip, and some hated that this advertisement occupied the middle of content and took up very large area of space.
Second one was pre-roll video advertisements, which 25% of users said were relatively easy to skip. Many users were also frustrated and annoyed that they saw the same pre-roll advertise repeatedly and felt that if advertisers could not avoid showing the same advertise twice, then they should make it relatively easier for consumers to escape or skip or block the advertises.
At last, 27% of consumers felt that rich media banner advertises which appears in feed were much easy to skip or block. Specifically, consumers didn’t like that they couldn’t escape or skip or block advertises when it started and played for a much lengthy period of time.
The survey's responses and answers were not actually surprising, and in fact they also explain the much rapid growth of mobile advertisement blocking. The Internet Advertisement Bureau study found that one in every 11 respondents currently use mobile advertise blockers in the U.S. and 19% had done so in the past.


### 1.3 Aim and Objective of Xplore OR How Xplore revolutionize current system

Xplore is conceptualized to solve the problems with digital advertising system. 
As mentioned above, most users are annoyed by ads while using the phone/web. This effects the advertisers also.
The revenue from advertising industry is huge, but it’s because of the large user base of mobile devices and internet.
For example, most user mistakenly clicks On-Click ads trying to close that. This is counted as click for advertise but in reality, that is futile and which means that it is meaningless.
Xplore will revolutionize this situation by adding the fun factor to advertisements. Xplore is a business side project. Xplore aims at changing the current static advertising system to dynamic level.
Today, A cricket bat ad or a rice brand ad, both have same layouts. Be it on-click ads or video ads. Also user don’t have any interaction in this system. 
Xplore gives option to generate advertisement according to product along with adding the user interaction factor in it.
As shown below most user aren’t bothered by ads but by annoying ads.

### 1.4 Detail Specification of Xplore

Xplore is a system which generates advertisement based games/quests.
Xplore also will provide a user interface to consumer side using which consumers can play games and quests.
On completion of every milestone of any game/quest, User will be rewarded with store credit or/and free product or/and offer or/and coupons and so.
Entire game/quest will be generated such that all its aspect covers the advertising requirement.
For example,

If a burger company wants to advertise its new store franchise, a treasure hunt game can be a good interactive advertisement.
First successful completion will get a mega reward.
Each milestone will involve reaching a franchise store, eat a burger and solve the code given with burger.
Successful completion will be the one who have all solved code across all stores.

Above example will also advertise the whole franchise. A particular burger product can be preferred to advertise. Many such features can be added in a single advertisement.
This advertisement prototype is highly dynamic.
For different product, different advertisers, advertising prototype will be generated such that it leads to maximum user interaction along with fruitful advertising.
Xplore will be prepared for advertises which can’t be suitable for game/quests. Xplore will have a solution for such advertises in best possible way. We are not thinking about such implementation as of now, but this will be our target on completion of current implementation.

### 1.5 Literature/Market search about Xplore concept

We researched a lot about digital advertising, interactive advertising, user experience of current advertising scheme and relevant subjects.

At first, we researched about the digital advertising industry size and its growth. 

We come to knowledge that this industry is growing by growth rate of 13% approx.

Tech Giant Facebook collects more than 80% of its revenue from advertising and also Google earns fairly large amount from its advertising APIs.

YouTube also depends highly on advertising.

We concluded that this industry will continue to grow for decade or so. And it will operate smoothly until the decline of mobile devices and internet which is highly unlikely.

### Then we researched about user experience.

Though we have the bright digits of industry size and growth, a large percentage (over 98%) of advertisement is still traditional.

Traditional advertisement involves the on-click ads, video ads, click-redirect ads.

Most user found such advertisements annoying.

Below is the survey result for choice to block all types of mobile ads on phone/tablet.

Most wants to block the ads because they found them annoying and misguiding.

Then we researched for interactive advertising.

Interactive advertising is a new genre in advertising. It demands user interaction. Listed below are its advantages,


1. Interactive advertising allows consumers to interpret advertisements in unique ways and understandings, and sheds light on the increasing importance of the consumer’s role in determining the value of marketing campaigns in today’s modern society. 

2. Interactive advertising wants users to actively engage in the marketing communications themselves to give feedback, ignore irrelevant elements, and grasp content that appeals to them.

3. As consumer-ism becomes more prominent within the global economy and social interactions become much more important in establishing healthy and stable long-term relationships with consumers, interactive advertising also grows in importance because it fires greater motivation for social interaction between potential users and advertisers. 

We also researched that why having so much advantages interactive advertising is not popular and we got below result,

1. While interactive advertising may be highly appealing to a prepared audience, it is also difficult, costly and time-consuming to prepare for, especially for some target markets that have yet to be properly identified and analysed.

2. Interactive advertising has much greater benefits in such industries where creativity helps to capture the attention of buyers. In some markets however, there is much little room for this, and excessive use of creativity can become a form of noise that disrupts the conveying of intended messages to consumers.




### 1.6 Flow of system

Xplore is a dynamic generator and operates in a dynamic way. There is different flow for each ad layout/prototype. Example of one such process is explained below:

Elaborated flow explanation for an AR type of advertisement quest

USER FLOW

1. Opens app.
2. Selects a quest from list (dynamic list by admin).
3. Destination is now given to user, User has to reach there.
4. After user reach destination. Selects a location point, if many.
5. Quest (of particular location point) is now given to the user.
6. User solves the quest, and assigned the reward.


GENERATOR FLOW/QUEST SETUP FLOW

1. A firm/store contacts the Admin.
2. By mutual agreement, Firm pays Admin the advertisement money (decided by Admin) and describes the Offer/Reward to be given to user.
3. Then Admin decides the location point(s) around the store and attaches a unique code to identify the location point (User will later scan the code and App will identify the location point).
4. Then Admin will click photographs of location point’s surrounding environment. 
5. Admin list out visual items and set clues for them and attach to location point in database.
6. Now when user will upload the clicked item photograph. It will be matched against the Admin’s photograph and verified.
